# Joy Bundle Demo Project

This project serves as a **proof of concept** to showcase the proposed structure and capabilities of a 3rd-party dependency, referred to as a "bundle," within the Joy ecosystem.

**Please Note:** Similar to the main Joy project and the Web Application demo, this bundle demo currently does not have any functional runtime or compiler. It is purely illustrative of the proposed semantics and structure for external modules.

## Purpose

This demonstration illustrates how a self-contained Joy bundle could be organized and integrated into a larger Joy application. It highlights the potential for sharing reusable code, data models, and components across different projects.

## Bundle Structure and Capabilities

Bundles are designed to extend Joy applications by offering a modular way to incorporate shared functionalities and accelerate development.
